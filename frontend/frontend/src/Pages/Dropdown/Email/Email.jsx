            Dolly Parton, you’re going to burn a ton of cash on ineffective

              <strong>A Deep Business Audit</strong>
              <p>
                We’ll plug your financials, customer file, and marketing data
                into nova Intelligence, our proprietary technology platform. Our
                expert growth analysts will diagnose your biggest pain points,
                assess your unit economics, compare your LTV:CAC ratio to what’s
                healthy, and quickly map out the biggest needle mover metrics.

              <strong>Customer Insights + Persona</strong>
              <p>
                From there we’ll compare who you think your customer is to what
                it actually is. This isn’t just some subjective alliterative
                persona either, it’s actually baked in verified deterministic
                data based on their past purchase behavior, media consumption,
                and psychographics.

              <strong>Market Research</strong>
              <p>
                What are your competitors doing? What’s the overall size of the
                business opportunity (revenue size and total addressable
                market). Is it mature and commoditized? Is it emerging and
                requires category education as well as product education? We’ll
                include the watch outs and the low hanging fruit.

              <strong>Media Plan</strong>
              <p>
                Knowing your customer, your market, and your unit economics tees
                up how to properly spend your marketing dollars. Where to
                invest, when, how much, and by what channel and tactic to
                generate the best return on your investment.
