    question: 'What is an ESP (email service provider)?',
    answer:
      'An email service provider (ESP) is a tool that can help you automate your email campaigns. Some of the most popular ESPs are Klaviyo and Hubspot. Each ESP has its own set of pros and cons so it can be difficult to determine which one is the best fit for you. The Power Digital team understands this and is ready to help walk you through your options. Choosing an ESP is crucial to the success of your email marketing campaigns—don’t leave it to chance.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What email service providers do you work with?',
    answer:
      'We will work with any and all ESPs. However, as part of our email marketing services, we will review your current ESP and make recommendations for changes if we think there might be a better fit available. Some of our favorites include Klaviyo, Attentive, Hubspot, and Braze. Each is designed with a different business use-case in mind whether you’re a start-up, medium-sized business, or enterprise company.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is an automated email?',
    answer:
      'Once upon a time, you had to send emails manually and, unfortunately, some marketers still live in this world. But now you don’t have to thanks to email automation! An automated email is any message automatically sent from your ESP triggered by a user’s action or inaction on your website. For example, you can send an email to a customer who visits your website, fills their cart and starts the checkout process, but does not complete their purchase. The possibilities are endless!',
