    question: 'What’s an SEO audit?',
    answer:
      'An SEO audit is a crucial step in the Power Digital methodology. Our team will conduct a comprehensive review of your entire SEO setup both on and off-site to develop a deep understanding of your current strategy. Specific elements of evaluation include current metadata, backlinks, content, technical setup, and keywords. We will then use these findings to develop a robust strategic plan that will help increase your ranking on search engines and start driving more traffic directly to your website.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does SEO take?',
    answer:
      'Unfortunately, SEO does not usually show an immediate impact. It takes time for search engines to update your site’s relevancy and begin ranking it higher. Typically, you should begin to see results about 3 to 6 months after updates are made. That seems like a long time, but throughout that time period, you will notice increasingly positive changes in your metrics.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are SEO keywords?',
    answer:
      'Simply put, SEO keywords are words or phrases that describe the content of your site and what it is about. Search engines, like Google, then use that information to determine if the content is relevant to a particular search query and how the page should rank in those searches. In essence, keywords are what gives a web page its search ranking. And as a result, they are what help people find your website.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are SEO backlinks?',
    answer:
      'A backlink is also known as an inbound or incoming link and is created when another external website links to your site. Such links are particularly valuable for SEO because it helps to build a positive reputation for your website and its content. This is because the backlink acts as a signal to search engines that others find the content of your website to be valuable and credible. When many different sites link back to the same webpage or website, it allows search engines to infer that the content is worth linking to, and therefore also worth ranking higher on a search results page.',
